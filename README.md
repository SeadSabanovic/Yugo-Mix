# Yugo-Mix
### Simple MP3 Player made with jQuery

*Link to the project*: [Yugoslavian Funk](https://sabanovics.com/YugoMix/)
*Link to the only good archive of authentic Yugoslavian pictures*: [XXZ Magazin](https://www.xxzmagazin.com/)

For those who might want to check out a few old pics from the EX-Yu times, I intentionally left a couple in the **img** folder of this repository, plus I'd recommend checking out this XXZ website. As for the project, I wanted to design something retro, but also minimalistic to fit todays standards. Not much elements to interact with, except the *next, previous song, volume, time, play and pause.*
